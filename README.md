# Text-Recognition-Converting-Text-to-Speech-using-MATLAB
This project extracts text from image and convert that extracted text to speech using Matlab tools. This project is coded oN Matlab and linked with Matlab GUI to make it convenient to use. Text extraction and recognition have quite a lot of applications for automatic indexing or information retrieval such document indexing, content-based image retrieval, and the famous car plate recognition which further opens up the possibility for more improved and advanced systems. Converting text to speech also have many applications such as it is helpful for people who struggle to read or people who are visually challenged. This project uses Matlabâ€™s OCR function to recognize the text in an image file.
